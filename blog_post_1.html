        <h2>The Real Challenge Isn't Technical</h2>
        
        <p>Design systems have become the backbone of modern product development, but building one that actually scales beyond the initial enthusiasm is harder than most teams expect. After working on design systems for companies ranging from scrappy startups to established tech giants, I've learned that the technical components are often the easy part.</p>

        <h2>The Real Challenge Isn't Technical</h2>

        <p>Most design system initiatives start with great intentions: create reusable components, establish consistent patterns, and help teams move faster. The first few months usually go well. You build a component library, document the basics, and see some early adoption.</p>

        <h2>The Real Challenge Isn't Technical</h2>

        <p>Then reality hits. New feature requirements don't fit existing components. Teams start creating one-off solutions. The design system becomes a bottleneck rather than an accelerator. Sound familiar?</p>
