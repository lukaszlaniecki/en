                    <p>Even myself? Yes, however unlikely it may seem. It's not something I force myself to do - I just do it. And I love it! It's why I continue to reinvent myself, and why at 48 I seek new challenges, instead of being in some steady job.</p>

                    <p>It started with a steady profession though, one which people almost never leave, and which I did leave for good, after almost two decades. Law, a discipline that taught me the rigor of logic and the power of a clear argument.</p>

                    <p>Practing law for so many years gave me a solid foundation, which I continue to leverage even today, whenever certain circumstances call for it. For me even more important than knowing certain rules and how to interpret them, was the realization that those rules inform us only about the expected reality - in other words, reality is not 100% shaped by those laws. That's why we have all those mechanisms which we apply when law was broken. By the way, this is not a common realization.</p>

                    <p>There is always a choice - don't consume. But it's actually easier said than done, plus, should this be our only binary choice? Consume or not consume? How about educating people? How about changing how information is served to peolpe? As a matter of fact there are some first changes, and a lot will change in the foreseeable future. </p>

                <div class="item-number">01.</div>
                    <p>This issue is directly or indirectly linked to all the previous ones. It's the common thread. Also the X factor. Technology is never good or bad - it's neutral. It's how we use it. It never uses us - we use it! The idea that it uses someone comes from the victimhood mentality, and this kind of mentality leads to very bad outcomes. It has always been this way, and it will always stay this way.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="item">
                <div class="item-number">02.</div>
                    <p>Technology isn't going anywhere. It is here to stay, and develop. In order to  leverage it, and at the same time minimize the bad influence, we need to understand it and be able to choose how we use it.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="item">
                <div class="item-number">03.</div>
                    <p>So the first thing we need is education which isn't lagging behind. This is a real challenge, because on the one hand, technology is moving super fast, and on the other hand, inertia and victimhood mentality mess with our goal to advance as species. Which means that the other thing we need is an increased effort.</p>
