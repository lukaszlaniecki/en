More and more people turn to AI chatbots for emotional support, which in many cases leads to even more aggravated consequences.

                    <p>There are concrete things we can do about it, and paradoxically AI can help us generate and brainstorm a lot of reasonable and feasible solutions. Blaming social media or AI, or both, is a sign of weakness, and lack of resourcefulness. It's also completely unproductive to begin with.</p>

                    <p>A second career after establishing your first wasn't on people's radar even two decades ago. There were some exceptions to this rule, of which pro athletes were always probably the most prominent example. Now this rule is flipped for a lot of people, and there is no going back. This has its pluses, not obviously, but is something people need to learn to live with.</p>

                    <p>As long as it's something we're not used to, it will create in us anxiety and all sorts of other difficult emotions. Let's face it, it's always hard to be the pioneers. And right now many of us will need to become just that.</p>

And they are being addressed, in books, articles, panel discussions, podcasts, and by scammers who spread more fear in order to sell all sorts of quick and easy fixes. Which means that there is a lot of room for other initiatives.</p>

                    <p>Huge topic. Many young people are completely lost in terms of their future. And oftentimes they also have their own understanding of what work means, and what it should look like. This is not a new occurrence - perhaps it's how all of us once felt, to a lesser or greater degree. History never repeats itself, but it rhymes - true.</p>

                <div class="item-number">02.</div>
                    <p>What is unprecedented however is the amount of messages, content, media outlets and all sorts of advisers. The challenge lies in trying to do the right thing. But by whose measure? On the other hand, for the very first time in recorded history young people can leverage extremely powerful technology in virtually every possible way.</p>

                    <p>There are a lot of people and organizations with enough resources to address the lack of proper education and guidance. And some of them are doing it and are phenomenal at this. Could more people and organizations do it? Of course! It's not that they can't - it's that usually it's super hard to imagine those things in the first place.</p>

            <h2>Trend: Rapidly Growing Influence of Technology</h2>
            <h3>Addressing the emotional disconnect and lack of education</h3>

                <div class="item-number">01.</div>
                    <p>This issue is directly or indirectly linked to all the previous ones. It's the common thread. Also the X factor. Technology is never good or bad - it's neutral. It's how we use it. It never uses us - we use it! The idea that it uses someone comes from the victimhood mentality, and this kind of mentality leads to very bad outcomes.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="item">
                <div class="item-number">02.</div>
                    <p>Technology isn't going anywhere. It is here to stay, and develop. In order to  leverage it, and at the same time minimize the bad influence, we need to understand it and be able to choose how we use it.</p>

                <div class="item-number">03.</div>
                    <p>So the first thing we need is education which isn't lagging behind. This is a real challenge, because on the one hand, technology is moving super fast, and on the other hand, inertia and victimhood mentality mess with our goal to advance as species. Which means that the other thing we need is an increased effort.</p>

                        <p>It always delights me when seemingly very removed things suddenly have a common denominator. Some of the best ideas in the world were created this way.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some of those connections may seem crazy. That's fine, because who said they can't or shouldn't be, and why should anyone listen? Right? Creativity is stifled by the notions that something should or shouldn't be a certain way, and when people are willing to explore it thrives.</p>
